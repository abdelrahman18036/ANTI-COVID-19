# ANTI-COVID-19
Anti-covid-19 is a free online video chat website that allows users to socialize with each other without the need to register. The website targets the lower class communities who are facing the psychological consequences of social isolation. This class has limited internet packages and too old devices to use the modern known video chatting programs. The user can video chat with up to 15 people (limited only by user interface) at the same time. Also, the website is compatible with all browsers. On the other hand, it has a very friendly user interface with both languages English and Arabic .
